## Keypad 4x4 Design Project

# Overview
- This project involves designing a 4x4 keypad matrix interface. The keypad is a widely used input device that consists of 16 buttons arranged in 4 rows and 4 columns. It allows users to enter numeric or alphanumeric data by pressing the corresponding keys. The keypad will be interfaced with a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, ESP32, or FPGA) to process the key presses.
