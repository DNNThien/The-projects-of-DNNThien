# ⏳ Digital Clock Using ICs

This project is a **digital clock designed using basic integrated circuits (ICs)**, without the use of any microcontroller. It is a hardware-focused implementation that demonstrates digital logic design principles.

## 🔧 Components Used

- **IC 7447** – BCD to 7-segment decoder
- **IC 7490** – Decade counter
- **IC CD4060** – Oscillator and frequency divider
- **IC 74157** – 2-to-1 multiplexer
- **IC 7408** – AND gate
- **IC 7486** – XOR gate
- **7-Segment LEDs** – To display digits
- **Switches & Push Buttons** – For mode switching and time adjustment

## 🎯 Features

- **Time Display:** Shows hours, minutes, and seconds on 6-digit 7-segment displays.
- **Mode Switching:** Allows toggling between time display mode and time setting mode using a switch.
- **Time Adjustment:** Time can be increased or decreased using push buttons while in setting mode.

## 📌 Purpose

This project aims to:
- Practice digital logic design using TTL and CMOS ICs.
- Build a fully functional clock with manual time-setting capability.
- Understand how counters, multiplexers, and gates can be integrated in a practical system.
